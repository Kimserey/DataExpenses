# DataExpenses

A data expenses manager which takes .CSV as input and categorize expenses.

## Why am I doing this?

There are a lot of expense managers already.
Those are centered around money earned versus money spent.
While it is great for tracking expenses and managing budgets, it isn't great in correcting expense behaviours in long term.
A deeper analysis must be done to discover habits and behaviours in individuals.

I believe that the best way to analyze your expenses is to do it yourself.
In order to create good analysis, one needs to be intimate with the data.
You must know the data and understand it clearly which requires a lot of time.
Fortunately, I am intimate with my own expenses therefore I am creating this application with the goal of finding patterns and behaviours which I can correct for long term savings!

## 1. Expenses breakdowns

__What's the purpose?__

Look at the repartition of the expenses over the time.
Monitor the evolution of the spending in each category.
Check if a certain category dominate the spendings.
Detect irregularity in certain category.

### 1.2 Category breakdown

### 2.4 Monitor the expense ratio of each category

Ratio of expenses per month for each category.
